# SFML Testing
This is a small experimental project for building a game in SFML using C++. I am working on this project on and off, and do not intend to turn this projects into a full fledged game for the time being. 

This project is primarily built and tested on Linux using the `libsfml-dev` package installed for the SFML library includes. You may have to configure this project manually for it to compile correctly on your system.
