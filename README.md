# Experiments and Excercises
This repo is a collection of programming projects in various languages and  is ideally intended as a means to challenge myself in languages I already know or am wanting to learn. Some projects are solutions to [Kattis](https://open.kattis.com), while others may be from various programming books are just my own imagination.
